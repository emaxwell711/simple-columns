        My website will display the various content of my friend and photographer, Elle Fitzgibbons. Elle has worked with many different models and collaborators when creating her content and I would like to display those effectively for her. I plan to link to her other various social media accounts and to link her social media accounts back to this website. It will display the progression of her work, as well as the various types of photography styles she excels in. Additionally, I will show ways in which to patronize her work (by setting up an appointment, etc).

      <div class='lg=col-10   md=col-11 sm=col-6 xs=col-1'>
        <p>
          The website will display several sections of work, including: Fashion, Lifestyle and Beauty, tentatively. Theoretically, this website will promote Elle’s work and potentially bring in more revenue for her. The target demographic will be potential modeling clients as well as those seeking a photographer for their wedding/event. Websites of other photographers in the St. Louis area include: 

          <a href="http://www.nathanparker.co/"> Nathan Parker</a>
          and
          <a href="http://www.photographybyadm.com/">ADM Photography</a>

     <div class='lg=col-10   md=col-11 sm=col-6 xs=col-1'>
      <p> 
        In addition to the class website, I utilized the help of a friend who is a computing professional as well as various websites and content, including: 

        <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/"  >developers.google.com</a>
        and
        <a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/photography-website-design/"> this
          photography website blog.</a>

        Along with understanding how websites can have the best code (thanks to the open source community and many free resources) I also found a lot of insight from reading the various websites of other photographers and seeing the ways in which they were able to best display their photography without overwhelming the viewer with content. Many websites for other photographers exist and maintaining site interaction is arguably one of the most important aspects of building a website. It is not enough to get someone onto your site; you must be able to keep them there and, in  the best scenario, gain site interaction (setting up appointments, getting comments, sharing of the website, etc).

          Tentatively, I’m going to use this template. It is responsive, but is more complex than the standard 12-column type of responsive web design we covered in class.

          My website will tentatively have between 4-6 pages (depending on how many categories Elle decides on). Each page will have different functionality. The home page will contain links to all social media platforms her work will be on. The content pages will display various models and scene types. Another page will offer pricing for various types of sessions, as well as link to a google doc (or something of the sort) to aid Elle in scheduling appointments. I will use a template, more than likely, and modify it. This will be something that Elle will hopefully actually utilize, and using a template seems to be the smoothest transition to legitimate usability. I will likely buy a domain for Elle in the future but will likely use a SLU domain for the time being. The website will be tested throughout different browsers (mobile and web browser).
